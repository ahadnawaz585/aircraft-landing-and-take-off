airlanding and takeoff of aircraft simulation

1. aircrafts are generated randomly for take-off and landing 
2. five runways are available 
3. 3 runways have priority for landing
4. aircrafts are generated for landing with random fuel available mentioning airtime 
5. if any runway is assigned to an aircraft it will be reserved for a minute
6. low fuel aircraft will be kept on high priorty for landing
7. take off aircrafts can be asked to wait if landing queue is large 
8. runway is available for landing or take off once the aircraft has taken off or landed .
9. for real time for aircraft set realistic time for aircraft for landing or take off 
10.if all runways are occupied and landing aircraft fuel is exhausted , aircraft is crashed.
11.show stats of 
    - crashed aircrafts
    - what was runways status when the aircraft generated and stats of
           -landing time
           -take off time
           - fuel available
    -average wait time for 
           -landing
           -take off
12.Take off aircrafts are served fifo

To implement this aircraft simulation project in C++, you can use various data structures and algorithms to manage the different aspects of the simulation efficiently. Here's a brainstorming of how you can structure your solution:

Aircraft Class:

Attributes:
Aircraft ID
Type (landing or takeoff)
Fuel level
Airtime
Methods:
Constructor to initialize the attributes
Getter and setter methods
Runway Class:

Attributes:
Runway ID
Availability status (occupied or free)
Priority status (for landing runways)
Methods:
Constructor to initialize the attributes
Getter and setter methods
Queue Class:

Use separate queues for landing and takeoff requests.
Implement a priority queue for landing requests based on fuel level.
Time Simulation:

Use a timer or a time simulation mechanism to simulate the progress of time in the simulation.
Implement functions to update the status of aircraft and runways based on the elapsed time.
Crash Handling:

Implement a mechanism to check if the aircraft's fuel is exhausted, and if all runways are occupied, mark the aircraft as crashed.
Statistics Class:

Keep track of statistics for crashed aircraft, landing time, takeoff time, fuel available, and average wait time.
Implement functions to update and retrieve these statistics.
Simulation Manager:

Main class to manage the overall simulation.
Use data structures like arrays, linked lists, or vectors to store the instances of Aircraft, Runway, and Queue classes.
Implement logic to handle the priority of landing runways.
Simulate the arrival and departure of aircraft based on random generation and real-time constraints.
FIFO Queue for Takeoff:

Implement a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue for takeoff requests.
User Interface:

Create a simple user interface to display the current status of runways, queues, and statistics.
Logging Mechanism:

Implement a logging mechanism to record events during the simulation for later analysis.
Testing:

Develop a comprehensive testing strategy to validate the correctness and efficiency of your simulation.
Documentation:

Document your code thoroughly to explain the design choices, data structures, and algorithms used.
Remember to break down the problem into smaller components and design the classes and data structures accordingly. This is just a starting point, and you may need to adapt and refine the design as you start implementing the simulation.

airlanding and takeoff of aircraft simulation

1. aircrafts are generated randomly for take-off and landing 
2. five runways are available 
3. 3 runways have priority for landing
4. aircrafts are generated for landing with random fuel available mentioning airtime 
5. if any runway is assigned to an aircraft it will be reserved for a minute
6. low fuel aircraft will be kept on high priorty for landing
7. take off aircrafts can be asked to wait if landing queue is large 
8. runway is available for landing or take off once the aircraft has taken off or landed .
9. for real time for aircraft set realistic time for aircraft for landing or take off 
10.if all runways are occupied and landing aircraft fuel is exhausted , aircraft is crashed.
11.show stats of 
    - crashed aircrafts
    - what was runways status when the aircraft generated and stats of
           -landing time
           -take off time
           - fuel available
    -average wait time for 
           -landing
           -take off
12.Take off aircrafts are served fifo

Aircraft Class:
Create a class to represent aircraft, containing attributes such as unique identifier, fuel level, airtime, and whether it is landing or taking off. Implement a method to calculate the remaining fuel after a certain airtime.

Runway Class:
Create a Runway class to represent each runway. Include attributes such as availability status, last landing/takeoff time, and a queue to store waiting aircraft.

Priority Queue for Landing:
Maintain a priority queue for landing aircraft, with priority based on fuel levels. Lower fuel levels should have higher priority. This ensures that low fuel aircraft are given preference.

Five Runways Array:
Create an array to represent the five runways. Initialize the three runways with landing priority and the other two for takeoff.

Main Simulation Loop:
In the main simulation loop, generate aircraft randomly for landing or takeoff. If it's a landing aircraft, enqueue it in the priority queue. If it's a takeoff aircraft, enqueue it in a FIFO queue for takeoff.

Landing Algorithm:
For landing, check the priority queue and assign the first available runway from the landing priority runways. Reserve the runway for a minute. If all three priority runways are occupied, low fuel aircraft will wait until a runway becomes available or crash if fuel is exhausted.

Takeoff Algorithm:
For takeoff, check the FIFO queue for takeoff. If a runway is available, assign it to the next takeoff aircraft. If all runways are occupied, takeoff aircraft can wait until a runway becomes available.

Statistics and Logging:
Keep track of crashed aircraft, landing and takeoff times, fuel available, and runway statuses. Calculate average wait times for landing and takeoff.

Realistic Time Handling:
Implement a mechanism to simulate realistic time for aircraft landing and takeoff. You can use a timer or timestamps for this purpose.

Output and Visualization:
Print or visualize the statistics, runway status, and other relevant information at regular intervals during the simulation.

Optimizations:
Implement optimizations such as efficient data structures for queues and priority queues, and consider parallelization to improve performance.

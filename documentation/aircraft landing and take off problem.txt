airlanding and takeoff of aircraft simulation

1. aircrafts are generated randomly for take-off and landing 
2. five runways are available 
3. 3 runways have priority for landing
4. aircrafts are generated for landing with random fuel available mentioning airtime 
5. if any runway is assigned to an aircraft it will be reserved for a minute
6. low fuel aircraft will be kept on high priorty for landing
7. take off aircrafts can be asked to wait if landing queue is large 
8. runway is available for landing or take off once the aircraft has taken off or landed .
9. for real time for aircraft set realistic time for aircraft for landing or take off 
10.if all runways are occupied and landing aircraft fuel is exhausted , aircraft is crashed.
11.show stats of 
    - crashed aircrafts
    - what was runways status when the aircraft generated and stats of
           -landing time
           -take off time
           - fuel available
    -average wait time for 
           -landing
           -take off
12.Take off aircrafts are served fifo
